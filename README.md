## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
## Summary
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance (as well as Intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. Vehicle Length having a p-value of 2.60e-12 and Ground Clearance having a p-value of 5.21e-08 both show to have statistical significance on MPG.
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The p-value from our model is below a significance level of 0.05% so we are able to reject the null hypothesis, identifying that the slope of this model is not zero.
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The R-squared value for this model is 0.715 which shows that 71% of the observed variations can be explained by this models inputs, proving to be a good model to predict MPG effectively.
